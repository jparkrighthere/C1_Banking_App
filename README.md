When pulling for the first time:

For client: CD into client and run "npm install". Next run "npm run dev" to start up the development server

For server: CD into server and run "python3 -m venv .venv" to set up a python virtual environment. Next run ". .venv/bin/activate" on mac or ".venv\Scripts\activate" on windows to activate the virtual environment. This creates an isolated env for the python project. Then run "pip install -r requirements.txt" to install all of the dependencies for the server. Finally run "python3 app.py" to start the server.
